# Machine Learning - Forecasting

A comprehensive collection of Jupyter notebooks and datasets for data science students in a bachelor program, focusing on machine learning techniques for forecasting and classification tasks.

## ðŸ“š Course Structure

This repository is organized by weekly topics, each containing practical notebooks and corresponding datasets:


## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages (see installation section)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bilal-ozden/Machine-Learning---Forecasting.git
cd Machine-Learning---Forecasting
```

2. Install required packages:

jupyter notebook
```

## ðŸ“– Notebook Structure

Each notebook follows a consistent structure for better learning experience:

1. **Title** - Clear description of the topic
2. **0-Setup** - Import statements and initial configuration
3. **1-Data Loading and Exploration** - Dataset loading and initial analysis
4. **2-Data Processing** - Data cleaning and preprocessing
5. **3-Model Building** - Algorithm implementation and training
6. **4-Evaluation** - Model performance assessment and interpretation

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By completing these notebooks, students will learn:

- **Data Manipulation**: Using pandas for data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing
- **Visualization**: Creating informative plots with matplotlib and seaborn
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: 
  - Decision Trees for classification
